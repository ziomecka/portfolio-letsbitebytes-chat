# About

* The application is a demonstration project and I am still coding it. The next step involves coding the server side user database.

* The current version of the application is running at [heroku](http://letsbitebytes-chat.herokuapp.com/).

  For demonstration purposes, I provided two users &#39;trainer&#39; and &#39;trainee&#39; with empty passwords. Please note that the user data is not currently stored in any database (only logins and passwords in the server&#39;s memory).
